# Machine Learning

## Subject: Introduction Machine Learning

The subject includes basic knowledge of computer security and basic knowledge of information security. The subject content consists of 10 chapters, each of which is a topic on current information security such as identification and authentication, user access control, database security, software security, encryption. , network security etc ...

## Present machine learning issues by building machine learning models for classification
problem.
1) Standardize data: using a dataset of numeric and categorial (nominal) types

2) Processing with unbalanced data, it means there is unequal/or bias distribution of classes
in the dataset.

3) Draw a chart showing statistical information of the dataset: quantity by labels (classes).

4) Solving the problem by using classification models: kNN, NB, SVM, Logistic Regression,
MultiLayer Perceptron (i.e FFNN).

5) Using early stopping for training process, using validation dataset.

6) Train the model using parameters: batch size and epoch number.

7) Display model evaluation results with different measures.

8) Present the overfiting issue and illustrate this issue through examples.

9) Presenting (by a program) an example of using Convolution Neural Network or Long Short
Term Memory


## Use libraries:
Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, keras.
